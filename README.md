# 1.Keyboard Build Guide (Step by Step)
### Step 1 - Install the light guide column on the top case.
- <img width="4096" height="1892" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e8dd836-049a-4ccc-9dbe-a02ad2225d24" />
### Step 2 - Prepare the bottom case:
- Install the C5 daughterboard + JST-SH cable, and fasten with 4 gold M2 screws (use the black hex key).
- Install the clear waterproof plug (Bottom RST insert) + 4 white rubber feet.

- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="2 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e660e063-2bf3-49fd-9e3d-bc35f77eaef1" />
- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="2 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4153be33-54a6-47da-ae1b-4b81af275754" />
### Step 3 - PCB (front side):
- Install the switch pad.
- Install the 6.25 silent stabilizer.
- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e6b58b0-0ae5-4a7e-bb35-4798be654cfe" />
### Step 4 - On the plate (positioning plate):
- Install one set of the modular gasket units. (3 sets included—choose one set to install; tweezers recommended.)
- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f301b2ba-fa14-4e0e-bba2-cc937d2b96d8" />
- Cut along the red line, and you'll get three sets（four in each set） of gasket bases of different thicknesses. The thicker the gasket base, the firmer the typing feel.
- <img width="1560" height="1350" alt="537334442-ac5a1482-6b37-4f1a-8912-d3b16d8b9b8c" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f93bdacd-3535-4608-99ee-d255b7ac9b24" />
- <img width="2417" height="3374" alt="gasketsys" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b9e8ca-8f49-4ed2-8ad9-9e9e629e042a" />
- **Modular Gasket System**
- The modular gasket system consists of two components: a inverted T-shaped plastic support base on the bottom, and a hollow cylindrical silicone gasket insert on top. The plastic base comes in three different thicknesses, and the gasket insert is available in three structural stiffness levels. These can be combined in various ways to achieve different typing feels. Users may also choose to omit the T-base or use only the central post without the lower disk to achieve the softest possible configuration. The system is compatible with positioning plates ranging from 1.5 mm to 3 mm in thickness.
### Step 5 - Assemble the front side:
- Install the plate onto the PCB, then install switches + keycaps. (Never install or remove switches or keycaps while the PCB and plate assembly is inside the keyboard case. Otherwise, excessive pressure may BREAK the battery power switch on the top side of the pcb)
- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="5 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3dfa504-74b4-4fc2-a8dd-18c90b310c2a" />
- <img width="4096" height="2160" alt="5 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e14fc34a-a3c0-46bf-9deb-93c72d6b8068" />
### Step 6 - PCB (back side):
- Install the HAC-006 battery. Ensure the red wire is on the positive (+) side and the black wire is on the negative (−) side. Connecting a battery with reversed polarity may damage the PCB and could potentially become a fire hazard.
### Step 7 - Wiring + battery placement:
- Connect the cable from the daughterboard to the main PCB.
- Place the battery into the battery compartment (Optional: adding foam inside the compartment can help keep the battery firmly in place).

### Step 8 - Mount the assembly into the case:
- First, fit the black battery power switch on top of the PCB into the slot in the middle of the dark gray battery switch cover. Then place the plate and PCB assembly into the bottom case, seating all four gasket bases into the gasket slots.
- Make sure all four gasket bases are fully seated (check from the PC bottom side). If needed, use tweezers to adjust them to ensure proper seating.

### Step 9 - Close the case:
- Install the top case and tighten 4× silver M3 screws (use the silver hex key). Use the two longer screws on the rear side, and the two shorter screws on the front side.
- <img width="2055" height="1314" alt="9 1 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829eeab7-e44a-493b-8d3d-a79bdee5d708" />

### Step 10 - Test / keymap check:
- Connect the keyboard to a computer, then open ZMK Studio in Chrome to check or change the keymap.
### Step 11 - Bluetooth pairing:
- Disconnect any existing connection.
- Turn on the keyboard power switch.
- Green LED flashes + blue LED flashes → pair/connect on your computer.

   Note: 0.5 mm raise, works better for low-profile keycaps such as PBS. You can also use [switch spacers](https://geon.works/products/geon-stem-spacer?srsltid=AfmBOooK4cco2RwcFHYfF9rAVdn84qZb2I-Wq4TTOvM8VZp1q8ff4KnT) on each switch.
- I personally use a thick CNC carbon plate paired with silent tactile switches, and the stability and sound dampening are both excellent. However, because pure carbon fiber does not look very clean after cutting, the edges can appear rough and the layers may slightly lift. For this reason, we decided to use white FR4 for the final group buy.
- Both thin and thick CNC aluminum plates also perform very well. That said, since an aluminum plate and an aluminum top case have similar hardness, they may contact each other at the locating points, which could leave minor marks on the aluminum top case. Therefore, if you choose a metal plate made by cutting or CNC, please keep this in mind.
